Community pharmacist referral to general practice - unexplored territory in reducing antibiotic resistance (pilot study).
Resources
Describe the resources necessary to conduct the project including financial support
We have received $16, 800 in funding to conduct this project. This will be used to hire an study coordinator for recruitment of
general pracitioners (GPs) and community pharmacies (CPs), administration, data entry and any follow up.
Other human resources: in-kind.
Software resources: all software used are readily available via Bond University Software Centre.
No monetary or material incentives will be provided to participants.
No other resources are required.
Background to the Project
Provide a brief plain language theoretical overview and project rationale.
Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to society. Antibiotic use is the key driver of antibiotic resistance, and it is a common
assumption that reducing use will reduce resistance. Antibiotic use is most common in the community, interventions that target
community antibiotic use stand to make the greatest impact on antibiotic resistance.
So far, most interventions have focused on changing the prescriber behaviour (i.e. general practitioner or GP); however,
Australia still has one of the highest rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.
In order to continue to reduce antibiotic resistance, it seems that multifaceted approaches targeting all stakeholders in the
supply chain are required. Therefore, this project focuses on the role of the community pharmacist (CPs) as they are another
vital link in reducing antibiotic use.
A known driver for antibiotic prescribing is patient GP visits; that is, just by being in the GP office increases the likelihood
of
antibiotic prescription. Anecdotal evidence suggests that CPs frequently refer patients to GPs for antibiotics; however, the
extent of this has never been quantified before.
We aim to quantify the referral rates of CPs to GPs for antibiotics. We anticipate the findings of this study could uncover new
intervention avenues to reduce antibiotic resistance.
Describe the research questions, aims, objectives and hypothesis
We aim to quantify CP referral rates to GPs for antibiotics. We plan to fulfil this aim through prospective audit in both CPs and
GPs settings to estimate the proportion of:
patients presenting to the pharmacy with minor ailments that are recommended medical referral for antibiotic, as
recorded by the pharmacist; and
GP clinic visits for infection are due to CP referral.
Describe the expected outcomes and impacts of the research
Results of this study will help us understand the extent of CP contribution to GP visits for antibiotics and help us decide whether
CP
referral is a new opportunity in reducing antibiotic resistance. Results will therefore enable us to understand the variance
in
referral rates amongst CPs and will be used to develop a national study to quantify CP referral rates to GPs for antibiotics.

Project Design
Describe the Rationale for your choice of research methods as specified in the HREA. How do these support the research
objectives of your research project?
We will be asking Autralian CPs and GPS to complete a prospective survey of patient encounters using a simple data collection
tool (see below).
While pharmacy assistants are often the first port of call for patients in community pharmacy, staff members are trained to
consult with the pharmacist for advice on whether to refer a patient for further medical attention. Therefore, we will be asking
for ailment consultations and referrals managed by the pharmacist only.
Previous studies have used observation and mystery shopper techniques to evaluate pharmacy triage(15); however, as we
wished to document internal intent for referral (i.e.: pharmacist believes that they may need antibiotics) that may not be made
explicit to the patient, we did not feel these methods would accurately capture internal clinical decision making. Cross sectional
study design asking pharmacists to retrospectively estimate number of referrals is prone to recall bias and was therefore not
considered appropriate for this study.
In addition, CPs and GPs are often pressed for time and filling in complex data collection forms could lead to under recording.
We have therefore also developed and piloted a simple CP and GP data collection tool to minimise impact on GP time for data
collection
We
had originally planned to use clinical interventions documentation for CP data collection as clinical intervention
documentation is part of the pharmacist usual workflow and pharmacies receive some remuneration for recording
of
clinical

interventions. However, completion of clinical interventions is not mandatory; as a result, not all pharmacists complete the
clinical interventions forms after every minor ailment, nor it it possible quickly and consistently extract data regarding reason for
and timing of referral. Therefore, we have opted to use the simple data collection tool instead that is analogous to the GP data
collection tool.
Provide a description of the participants planned for your study. How many you will need? What are your inclusion/exclusion
criteria? How will participants be recruited? What is your estimate and rationale of sample size?
We
will be asking registered Autralian CPs and GPs to complete a prospective survey of patient encounters.
As
referral rates of pharmacists to GPs for antibiotics have never been quantified, a robust sample size calculation and random
sampling framework is not feasible; therefore, for the purposes of this pilot study, we will be using a convenience sample of CPs
and GPs. Future studies will use this pilot study data to develop a robust sampling framework.
Community Pharmacists:
CPs within the Ramsay Pharmacy Group, which has 43 community pharmacies across Victoria, NSW and Queensland will be
invited to participate. Additional CPs will be recruited through practice relevant magazines, newsletters, and Facebook groups
(such as those hosted by the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia), snowballing, and through colleagues and known contacts.
Additional CPs will also be personally contacted through colleagues and known contacts.
We piloted our data collection tool with two Victorian, one NSW and one Queensland CP how many minor ailment consultations
they encountered in a shift, and how many they referred for antibiotics. Data indicated CPs dealt with approximately 10 minor
ailments per day, and 10% of these were referred to a GP for antibioticsl. Assuming the combined population of Victoria, NSW
and Queensland combined is 19,400,000 (26) with 4300 community pharmacies,(27) and that it will take approximately one
week to deliver 50 minor ailment consultations, we will require a minimum of 10 pharmacies to estimate the percentage of
consultations that result in referral to a GP for antibiotics to within +/-5% with 95% confidence. This calculation assumes an
expected proportion of 20% and a design effect of 2.
General Practice:
GPs will be recruited using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. We will advertise in practice relevant magazines,
newsletters, and Facebook groups (such as those hosted by GPs down under) Additional GPs will also be personally contacted
through colleagues and known contacts.
We piloted our data collection tool with two Queensland GPs. They used the tool after 36 patient consultations and found none
were referred by a CP and that 33% of new issues were due to infection.2
Assuming that there are 19,903 full time GPs in Victoria, NSW and Queensland,(28 and that on average GPs provide
approximately 30 consultations a day (given a 15 min time(2S we will require a minimum of 21 GPs collecting data on at least
20
patients to estimate the percentage of patients referred to a GP by a CP that were to within +/-5% with 95% confidence. This
calculation assumes an expected proportion of 5% and a design effect of 5.
Emails and social media posts will be sent out three times to maximise recruitment; once at week 0, week 2 and then week
6;
and will contain a link to the study ebsite httpsllpstehlikwixsitecom/pharmacistrererral' where participants are able to
view and download the participant information sheet. This will be repeated one month after week 6 if additional recruitment is
required.
1 Piloting was conducted during mid-January, the quietest time of year for most community pharmacies, these numbers are
most likely an under-estimation of usual minor ailment consultations.
2
Piloting was conducted during mid-January when antibiotic use is lowest.

A contact email will also be provided on the website should potential participants want further information. If participants wish
to
participate, they will be asked to email the study coordinator and request the data collection form. Consent will be implied
with the return of the data collection tool.
What instruments / materials are you using? If possible provide validity and reliability of instruments or address the validity of
the method.
Community pharmacists will be asked to fill out a simple data collection form (see: Pharmacist Data Collection Tool).
General Pracitioners will be asked to fill out an analogous data collection form (see: GP Data Collection Tool).
Both tools have face validity and have been piloted with stakeholders.
Describe your procedure. What will participants be asked to do? How much time is required of paricipants at a test session and in
total? Will there be any follow-up?
Community pharmacists at participating pharmacies will be asked to complete the pharmacist post-consultation record form for
50 consecutive minor. ailment consultations. They will be asked to document information about the patient (seld or proxy,
approximate age, and gender), if they referred the patient (immediately, conditionally, or not at all), where they referred them
to
(GP, ED, other), and reason for referral (Patient likely needs ANTIBIOTICS or Patient likely needs further medical evaluation
and/or other prescription but NOT antibiotics).
Additional information collected about the pharmacy and data collection period include information about the data collection
period (start and finish date, if data collection occurred outside of office hours, how busy the pharmacy was), and information
about the pharmacy (postcode, state, region: urban rural etc, and location: co-located with GP, medical center, street, etc).
General practitioners will be asked to complete the GP post-consultation record form for 20 consecutive consultations. They will
also be asked to document information about the patient (age, gender), presenting problem (infection, medication related,
other), and who referred the patient (self, family friend, CP or other). As this last piece is not part of usual practice, GPs will
be
instructed to ask their patients whether they had been referred by someone after each consultation.
Additional information collected will be whether data collection occurred clinic type (traditional practice, medical centre,
specialist clinic), GP location (co-located in or next to a pharmacy, state, postcode, region: urban rural etc), when the data were
collected (month and year only, and whether data was collected in and/or out of office hours).
No other data will be collected about individual health professionals or the patient.
We anticipate that the data collection will take significantly less than one minute per patient. No follow-up will be required.
We also anticipate that participants will not be at any risk of harm as a result of data collection other than inconvenience
of
completing the form.
How will you handle the withdrawal/loss of any participants from your study?
Participants are able to withdraw at any time by contacting the study coordinator in writing and requesting that their data be
removed; all data will be removed from analysis.
For GPs this means their individual data, for pharmacists this will mean mean removal of the pharmacy's data.
Describe your data analysis. What are your measures? How will data be coded? Include any matching and sampling strategies,
data linkages, strategies for accounting for potential bias, confounding factors and missing information and statistical power
calculation.
Each GP and pharmacy will receive their own unique study identifier and will also be coded as "GP" or "Pharmacy".
We will be using descriptive statistics to quantify:

The
number of patients presenting to the pharmacy with minor ailments that are recommended medical referral

The number of patients GP clinic visits for infection are due to CP referral.
Exploratory analysis we will also used (e.g. heirachical logistic regression) to describe the potential impact of location and type of
pharmacy and GP practice, pharmacy open hours, gender and age of patient on referral rates. This analysis will be purely
exploratory/ hypothesis generating in nature and inform future study design.

Closure and Dissemination
Ethics approval covers not only the collection of data but also issues such as dissemination of data, researchers' duty of care
for
participants after data collection, and responsibilities to the institution, professional bodies and research partners/sponsors. This
is the closure phase of research.
How do you plan to disseminate the results of your research, including to participants and stakeholders? Include any publications
that are planned as a result of this research.
We plan to submit findings for publication in late 2019 to an Australian journal and present at the National Medicines
Symposium in 2020.
We also plan to provide all participats with a copy of the final manuscript should they request a summary of findings from the
researchers.
Describe the project closure processes and plans for any follow-up research.
We will cease data collection on the 30th November 2019.
Future work will further explore the patient journey to acquiring antibiotics, including appropriateness of CP referrals, clinical
decision making of CPs during referrals, patient compliance with referrals, and impact of CP referrals on GP antibiotic prescribing
rates. Exploring the patient journey from CP minor ailment consultation to antibiotic prescription will help us develop CP
antibiotic stewardship strategies, an area that is currently under developed.
